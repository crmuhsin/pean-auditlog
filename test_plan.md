For our test plan we can use the following tests


# Unit test
we will need to test the smallest units.
#### Front end
- authentication works as expected
- UI is consistent
- all auditlogs shown in correct format

#### Back end
- authentication token working perfectly

# API testing
- all api serves response in a consistent manner
- all api is working

# Integration Test
- test if individual components fully working
- in backend test if individual API sets fully working
